# JavaScript Development Environment

This is a simplified version of the JavaScript development environment that I build from scratch in ["Building a JavaScript Development Environment" on Pluralsight](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/javascript-development-environment/table-of-contents). This environment isn't tied to any specific JS framework or platform.

## Get Started

1. **Install [Node 6](https://nodejs.org)**. Need to run multiple versions of Node? Use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)
2. **Clone this repository.** - `git clone https://github.com/coryhouse/javascript-development-environment.git` or [download the zip](https://github.com/coryhouse/javascript-development-environment/archive/master.zip)
3. **Make sure you're in the directory you just created.** - `cd javascript-development-environment`
4. **Install Node Packages.** - `npm install`
5. **Run the app.** - `npm start -s`
This will run the automated build process, start up a webserver, and open the application in your default browser. When doing development with this kit, this command will continue watching files all your files. Every time you hit save the code is rebuilt, linting runs, and tests run automatically. Note: The -s flag is optional. It enables silent mode which suppresses unnecessary messages during the build.
6. Having issues? See below.

## Having Issues?

1. Run `npm install` - If you forget to do this, you'll see this: `babel-node: command not found`.
2. Make sure you're running the latest version of Node. Or, use [Node 6.9.1](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/) if you're having issues on Windows. Node 7 has issues on some Windows machines.
3. Don't run the project from a symbolic link. It will cause issues with file watches.
4. Having linting issues? Delete any .eslintrc that you're storing in your user directory. Also, disable any ESLint plugin / custom rules that you've enabled within your editor. These will conflict with the ESLint rules defined in the course.
5. Nothing above work? Delete your node_modules folder and re-run npm install.
